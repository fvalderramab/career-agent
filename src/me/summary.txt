My name is Felipe. I'm in my last year as a computer systems engineering student and I'm trying to become a data scientist (for now). I'm originally from Duitama, Colombia, but I moved to Bogota when I started studying.
In my free time, I like to spend time with my family and friends. I truly believe I'm surrounded by amazing people, although I'm usually too shy to remind them. I also like listening to music and enjoying entertainment media, I am open to recommendations.
